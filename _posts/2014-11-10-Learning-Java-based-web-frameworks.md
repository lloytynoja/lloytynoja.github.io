This is the first post in my journey of learning Java-based web frameworks. I'm coming from PHP world, having worked mainly with Drupal and Laravel 4. PHP ones are nice in a way that they're immediately usable after firing your XAMPP or such server. Java based ones have always had seemingly so steep learning curve, with all that necessary tooling, that I've not put in the needed effort to start learning them. Until now - I'll be putting my hands in the clay, as the (Finnish) saying goes.

So, after some research, Spring Framework is maybe the most popular Java-based framework out there. That'll be on my list, along with not-as-popular Play Framework (using Java, not Scala). Lot of things of Play framework resemble me of the Laravel, so I'll be starting with it. 

Posts I intend to create serve me as notes, but hopefully I can help other beginners out there as well! At least I'll be covering the installation of tools, creating a simple CRUD application with database and a REST interface. Maybe then I'll proceed to more advanced topics, but let's master the basics first!
