This circular control plugin for D3 is the main UI control of my recent metronome project. I'm not sure if I'll ever finish the metronome, as I already found a really good one with timer, which I especially sought after, as well as loads of other features. I still decided to release this control as proper D3 plugin with unit tests and documentation.

By the way - if you're in need of decent metronome, check this out: [Tempo Advance](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tempo-advance-metronome-polyrhythms/id368169363?mt=8) Well suited for us drummers (Mike Mangini uses this too), but I'm think players of other instruments should check this out too.
